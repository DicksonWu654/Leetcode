# Leetcode

I've heard that Leetcode is a really good place to learn how to program - specifically how to optimize your solutions to cool problems! I'm not too good at optimizing my code so I'm giving it a try

##My process for doing Leetcode:
- Since I'm a total noob I'll be starting off on the easy questions
- I'll first do whatever comes to mind (probably brute force)
- Then I'll take 5 minutes to reflect on what I can optimize
- Then I'll check the discussions to see what others have done to optimize their code
- I'll implement their solution
- Think of how I can improve that
- Repeat until satisfied

Hopefully this repo will be useful to you! I show all my iterations, along with mini-explanations, to show the logic behind iterations!
